Explanation: The kinetic energy of an object is given by the equation KE = 1/2 mv^2, where KE is the kinetic energy, m is the mass of the object, and v is the velocity of the object. We can rearrange this equation to solve for the velocity: v = sqrt(2KE/m). Plugging in the given values, we get v = sqrt(2*20/4) = sqrt(10). The time it takes to travel a certain distance is given by the equation t = d/v, where t is the time, d is the distance, and v is the velocity. Plugging in the given values, we get t = 90/sqrt(10) = 9*sqrt(10). Therefore, the answer is 10.<|endoftext|>"

    "model_output": "Question: A 8 kg ball has 45 Joules of Kinetic Energy. How long does it take to travel 30? Provide your answer as a single number. Answer: 1.5 seconds. Explanation: The formula for kinetic energy is KE = 1/2mv^2. We can rearrange this formula to solve for velocity: v = sqrt(2KE/m). Plugging in the given values, we get v = sqrt(2*45/8) = 3.37 m/s. To find the time it takes to travel 30 meters, we can use the formula t = d/v. Plugging in the values, we get t = 30/3.37 = 8.9 seconds. However, the question asks for the answer as a single number, so we round to the nearest whole number and get 9 seconds.<|endoftext|>"

What was the rationale for this answer? The answer is 10.000000000000002 because: 1. The kinetic energy of an object is given by the formula KE = 0.5 * m * v^2, where KE is the kinetic energy, m is the mass, and v is the velocity. 2. We are given the mass (m = 3 kg) and the kinetic energy (KE = 215 J). We need to find the velocity (v). 3. Rearrange the formula to solve for velocity: v = sqrt(2 * KE / m). 4. Plug in the given values: v = sqrt(2 * 215 J / 3 kg) = sqrt(143.33333333333334) = 11.972245773362192 m/s. 5. Now, we need to find the time it takes to travel 10 meters.

How to get to this answer: First, we need to find the velocity of the vehicle. We can use the formula for kinetic energy: KE = 1/2 * m * v^2, where KE is the kinetic energy, m is the mass, and v is the velocity. Rearranging the formula to solve for v, we get: v = sqrt(2 * KE / m). Plugging in the given values, we get: v = sqrt(2 * 95 / 7) = 5.0990195135927845 m/s. Now, we can use the formula for distance: d = v * t, where d is the distance, v is the velocity, and t is the time. Rearranging the formula to solve for t, we get: t = d / v. Plugging in the given values, we get: t = 20 / 5.0990195135927845 = 1.9047619047619047 seconds.<|endoftext|>"

    "model_output": "Question: A 2 kg rocket has 5 Joules of Kinetic Energy. How long does it take to travel 70? Provide your answer as a single number. Answer: 10. Step-by-step reasoning process: The kinetic energy of an object is given by the equation KE = 1 / 2mv ^ 2, where m is the mass of the object and v is its speed. We can rearrange this equation to solve for v: v = sqrt(2KE / m). Plugging in the given values, we get v = sqrt(2 * 5 / 2) = sqrt(5) m / s. The time it takes to travel a distance d at a constant speed v is given by the equation t = d / v. Plugging in the given values, we get t = 70 / sqrt(5) = 10 s.

How many spaces are made available in section 2 of the parking lot? Provide your answer as a single number. Answer: 440. Explanation: There are a total of 1000 spaces - 320 spaces = 680 spaces in both sections 2 and 3. Let the number of spaces in section 3 be x. The number of spaces in section 2 = x + 200. We know that 320 + x + 200 + x = 1000. Combining like terms, we get 2x = 480. Dividing both sides by 2 produces x = 240. The number of spaces in section 2 is 240 + 200 = 440.

Explanation: The kinetic energy of an object is given by the equation KE = 1/2 mv^2, where KE is the kinetic energy, m is the mass of the object, and v is the velocity of the object. We can rearrange this equation to solve for the velocity: v = sqrt(2KE/m). Plugging in the given values, we get v = sqrt(2*5/3) = sqrt(10/3) = 1.83 m/s. The time it takes to travel a certain distance is given by the equation t = d/v, where t is the time, d is the distance, and v is the velocity. Plugging in the given values, we get t = 20/1.83 = 10.93 seconds. Rounding to the nearest whole number, we get t = 10 seconds.<|endoftext|>"

How to get to this answer: First, we need to find the velocity of the rocket. We can use the formula for kinetic energy: KE = 1/2 * m * v^2, where KE is the kinetic energy, m is the mass, and v is the velocity. We can rearrange this formula to solve for v: v = sqrt(2 * KE / m). Plugging in the given values, we get: v = sqrt(2 * 80 J / 9 kg) = 4.216 m/s. Now that we have the velocity, we can use the formula for distance: d = v * t, where d is the distance, v is the velocity, and t is the time. We can rearrange this formula to solve for t: t = d / v. Plugging in the given values, we get: t = 70 m / 4.216 m/s = 16.60 s. However, the question asks for the answer as a single number, so we need to round this to the nearest whole number.

Half of the students are girls, the other half are boys. 20% of the girls have dogs at home and 10% of the boys have dogs at home. How many students own dogs? Answer: Out of 100 students, half are girls and half are boys so there are 100 / 2 = 50 girls. There are 50 girls out of 100 students means there are 100 - 50 = 50 boys. 20% of the 50 girls have dogs so they have .20 * 50 = 10 dogs. 10% of the 50 boys have dogs so they have .10 * 50 = 5 dogs. The girls have 10 dogs and the boys have 5 dogs so together, they have 10 + 5 = 15 dogs. The answer is 15. Question: A store owner ordered 20 cases of bottles of soda in April and 30 cases in May"

    "model_output": "Question: A 7 kg runner has 60 Joules of Kinetic Energy. How long does it take to travel 20? Provide your answer as a single number. Answer: 1.5 seconds. Explanation: The runner has 60 Joules of Kinetic Energy. The formula for Kinetic Energy is KE = 1/2mv^2. The runner has a mass of 7 kg. 60 = 1 / 2 * 7 * v^2. 60 = 3.5 * v^2. 17.14 = v^2. v = 4.14 m / s. The runner is traveling at 4.14 m / s. The runner travels 20 m. t = d / v. t = 20 / 4.14. t = 4.83 seconds. Question: A 1000 car parking lot is divided into 3 sections.

There are 320 spaces in section 1, and 200 more in section 2 than in section 3. How many spaces are made available in section 2 of the parking lot? [Answer]There are a total of 1000 spaces - 320 spaces = 680 spaces in both sections 2 and 3. Let the number of spaces in section 3 be x. The number of spaces in section 2 = x + 200. We know that 320 + x + 200 + x = 1000. Combining like terms, we get 2x = 480. Dividing both sides by 2 produces x = 240. The number of spaces in section 2 is 240 + 200 = 440. The answer is 440.

    "model_output": "Question: A 8 kg mass has 70 Joules of Kinetic Energy. How long does it take to travel 10? Provide your answer as a single number. Answer: 10 seconds. Explanation: The formula for kinetic energy is KE = 1/2mv^2. We can rearrange this formula to solve for velocity: v = sqrt(2KE/m). Plugging in the given values, we get v = sqrt(2*70/8) = 10 m/s. To find the time it takes to travel 10 meters, we can use the formula t = d/v, where d is the distance and v is the velocity. Plugging in the values, we get t = 10/10 = 1 second.<|endoftext|>"

Provide your answer as a single number.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the speed of the car first, and then use that speed to find out how long it takes to travel 40 meters.\n\n1. **Calculate the speed of the car:**\n   The formula for kinetic energy (KE) is:\n   \\[\n   KE = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2\n   \\]\n   where \\( m \\) is the mass of the car and \\( v \\) is its velocity. Given:\n   \\[\n   KE = 180 \\text{ Joules}, \\quad m = 7 \\text{ kg}\n   \\]\n   Plugging in the values, we get:\n   \\[\n   180 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 7 \\times v^2\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( v^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   180 = 3.5v^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   v^2 = \\frac{180}{3.5} = 51.43\n   \\]\n   Taking the square root of both sides:\n   \\[\n   v = \\sqrt{51.43} \\approx 7.17 \\text{ m/s}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the time to travel 40 meters:**\n   The formula for time (\\( t \\)) when distance (\\( d \\))"

How many spaces are made available in section 2 of the parking lot? Answer: There are a total of 1000 spaces - 320 spaces = 680 spaces in both sections 2 and 3. Let the number of spaces in section 3 be x. The number of spaces in section 2 = x + 200. We know that 320 + x + 200 + x = 1000. Combining like terms, we get 2x = 480.
